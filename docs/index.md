# Admer's guides

Hello! Here you can read guides/tutorials that I occasionally write.

Typically my tutorial-writing work is on [The Whole Half-Life](https://twhl.info/) and I also make [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZmAT317GNn19tjUoC9dlT8nv4f8GHcjy) on YouTube. But, sometimes, you just gotta write a guide that doesn't fit in either place, and especially when they aren't just about Half-Life modding.
