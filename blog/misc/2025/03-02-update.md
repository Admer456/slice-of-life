# Off to a great start

Happy New Year! Is it just me, or is the winter making me horribly sleepy non-stop? Or maybe I should just take small naps during the day.

<!-- truncate -->

So, it's 2025, and man. Not gonna lie, stuff isn't looking good out there. I'm slowly getting more concerned for my friends in other countries. I'm not gonna comment too much further on this, as there are still too many uncertainties.

Anyway, I'm happy to say I've almost entirely completed my [2024 resolution](../2024/01-08-legacy_quarter1.md#8th-of-january-2024). I've been single for nearly a year at this point, and I'm happy. I still don't feel as great as I did in 2021, but I have a very clear path towards it.

Here's what roughly happened throughout 2024:
* January: got a guitar, got a lot more into VRChat
* February: completed Zortch, rendering in Elegy
* March: huge breakup (yay mental health), got some extra furniture so my desk was no longer scuffed as heck
* April: started the GoldSRC Mapping series, fixed Virtual Desktop-VRChat issue
* May: made an Assetto Corsa track test, got done with The Job(tm), another breakup (single since)
* June: new chair, cousin and I started jamming
* July: Voices of the Void obsession, AC broke down
* August: started VRChat avatar, looking for a new job, ported this website to Docusaurus
* September: retook year in college, Elegy occlusion culling blog post, tried out 86box
* October: imported my TB house map into Blender, textured it real nice, ordered an isopod plushie
* November: started playing STALKER SoC again, got a new parttime gig
* December: isopod arrived, started playing Brazilian Drug Dealer 3, got more active in VRChat again, started working on a VRChat world (Questionable Ethics from HL), started drawing again, made tons of progress in Elegy also

So, yeah. Here I am now. For 2025, I have just two major goals:
* Save up plenty of money for the attic renovation project. This is a leftover from last year.
* Get Elegy to [milestone 0.2](https://github.com/ElegyEngine/ElegyEngine/issues/18).

Also a few smaller goals:
* Complete my VRChat avatar.
* Get a blender, air fryer and some new pans.
* Complete the Questionable Ethics port.
* Pass a few exams in college.
* Exercise more.

That's about it. I'll be writing about my VRC avatar and world and stuff in separate blog posts.

## Qt 6 is funny, and TrenchBroom-adm progress

So, TrenchBroom updated to Qt 6. And it led to [this issue](https://github.com/TrenchBroom/TrenchBroom/issues/4774) right here, which was embarrassingly fixed by me re-installing it.

Anyway, I ported all my changes over to TrenchBroom 2025, which are still in their branches. I also added custom grid sizing. I've yet to actually push the updated branches, but I'm in no hurry there.

What remains is to implement Source-style IO editing and also tackle supporting editors that don't support IO events, like J.A.C.K.

Oh yeah. I'll also need to update the TrenchBroom guide for this. Oh well. Until next time!
