# Q3 2024, Miscellaneous

## 21st of August, 2024

Alright, let's see what I wrote about last time...

Mental health.. mhm. Yeah, it's good now. I fixed my sleep schedule, too, I managed to wake up at 7:40 this morning and have proper pre-11:30 breakfast even. Back then it was a scramble to have brunch before 15:00, hah.

The VRChat + Virtual Desktop hack still works, annnd I've yet to actually automate it. Because of course, that's how it goes. My brother managed to complete Boneworks, Bonelab and Half-Life Alyx, all before me. <!-- truncate --> Because of course.

I've been looking for a new job lately. I can hardly believe I'm saying this, but going to the office every weekday would actually be quite nice!

### Life goals
I think I've completed one more New Year resolution goal too? Yeah, I actually got a new chair. Like. It's godly. It sure cost me 600â‚¬ but it was worth every penny! It's an ergonomic chair from a local Bosnian furniture company, and my back's been thanking me ever since I got it. The net is super comfy, the adjustable 3DOF armrests are PRICELESS. Oh man.

On the other hand, my AC broke down in late June. Eugh. The warranty expires in like a month or so, and the crew(tm) still ain't coming over to replace the unit, probably waiting for the warranty period to end. I despise companies that play around like that. Gorenje, more like Dojenje.

### YouTube stuff
I've released another video in the mapping series which got some okay reception.

I'm currently working on a new entry in the programming series, getting one step closer to finally ending the weapons chapter. I'd really like to move on to NPCs, later clientside stuff and then end the series.

Don't take it the wrong way. From the wording above, it sounds like I'm tired of it! But nah. I'm just a little exhausted in general this summer. 

I'll definitely make one more video in the weapon programming chapter, and then I'll make another couple videos for the GoldSRC Mapping series. And then, it'll probably be 2025. Hopefully I'll have some cool stuff to show by then.

### Jam
Remember how I got a guitar in January? Yeah. My cousin got inspired and got himself an Ibanez GRX20 from before he was born. It is still quite a lovely guitar, despite the rust on its two Humbuckers.

We've held 6 jamming sessions so far, meeting up almost every Saturday and making a new song each time. We've progressed quite a bit. I still need to learn a scale though.

### The rest
But yeah, that's about it for today. It's almost 16:00 and I gotta move onto some other stuff.

Now that I have a bit of experience using `docusaurus`, I've been thinking of moving this blog over to it. It would be very nice.
