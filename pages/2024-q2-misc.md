## 15th of April, 2024

Wew. I'm happy to say I've already reached a few goals I set for myself in January:
* mental health good
* started a HL mapping series
* got a real good microphone & audio interface
	* and a guitar
* started making videos in 1080p

Elegy is en route to becoming more and more usable, so that's cool.

For a little while, I'll hardly be making any money, don't have much to work on at my job since we finished a project recently. Not really good for my attic renovation project, but that's okay, I'm in no hurry there. I do have some other things to do, so I'll try to make a couple bucks by May.

### YouTube stuff

The series "GoldSRC Mapping" has finally started. The first video "Wanna make maps?" got some 16k views, so I'm 100% certain it's a good direction to go in. I also really like some of the new editing details I started putting in, so I think I'll keep doing them.

I'd love to pick up the moss mod or software water mod around May or so. I really gotta finish those eventually. We now have workarounds for the 25th anniversary update, so like, yeah.
