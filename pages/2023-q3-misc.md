Been busy with my jobs.

Half-Life software-style water has been shaderised: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ctXyW8  
Bacontsu is trying to get it into a HL mod, which is neat.

My hair is pretty long. I love it.

It’s the end of the month and damn is it a good one. Yesterday, on the 30th, I made software water in HL OpenGL, again. This time, it’s way better and more proper. It’s a proof of concept still, and it needs to render water surfaces from the BSP. It’s currently rendering one big water plane, plus we need to work out texture scaling and parametrisation.

Cousins left yesterday. It feels pretty weird without them, and there is an extra weird / half-depressing feeling when it’s the end of summer and school is about to start. I then realised, oh, I don’t quite have to suffer from that any more. It’s a little different for me now.

I completed most of HL SDK Programming 4.1. It is going rather splendidly.

Thinking about porting some of my Excel sheets into Google Sheets. It’d let me view them on the phone easily.

Today I did 20 squats and 6 pushups while waiting for my code to compile at work. Feels nice to do them in little amounts more frequently, honestly.

Quake 2 Remaster came out today, that is quite interesting. Nightdive’s *Kex engine* is at it again!

God damn, last night was cranky. I stayed up until 3 AM to get something at work done, but it’s still a bit broken.

HL SDK Programming 4.1 is almost done. Just gotta make the outro, then I may write the subtitles and publish the video, more or less.

Work is going pretty fine today.

It has been 2 days or so since I started fermenting my pizza dough. It's gonna remain in the freezer for another day, so I can make pizza tomorrow.

It would appear my brother is gonna move out into another room, either Grandma’s or his own. This is excellent news for me. Also, our AC broke down, but that means we’re getting a new inverter one. These news together mean I’ll finally have some privacy and this winter shouldn’t be too terribly cold. Finally, the life I intended to partially live.

It will be a miracle if I get done with TWHL tutorials this month. I began writing a Substance Automation bridge library for C#. I hope it’ll be useful to people. I also moved T.E.M.P. from an offline spreadsheet over to Google Sheets, that’s pretty nice.

Mm things are going a bit slow at work. I tried out the Obsidian Conflict beta today, and that was very dam fun.

There are now plans to let me live in the attic. We’re gonna renovate it this winter and spring, and I’ll have moved in there by summer. :)
