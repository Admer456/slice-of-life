Woo! We are in October now. The crunchy and stressful period is mostly over now, as I finished the deadline on job 2.

Also egh, I am getting tired of my chair. I bought it like 3-4 months ago, and it was extremely good at the time, but it has kind of lost a part of its volume and I am tired of not being able to adjust the back rest angle. Another thing I didn't account for is the fact it gets super warm after a couple hours.

Well, good thing is, I have a standard now. I found a far far better chair for like 310â‚¬ and I'm really thinking about it, but TBH it might be better for me to wait for Christmas or something like that. We'll see.

Oh yeah, also, I recently bought this [microfox.dev](microfox.dev) domain! If you are viewing from `admer456.github.io/slice-of-life`, which is highly unlikely, you should check out the new one now. Nothing is different, I just have my own sorta thing now.

I would really like to explore web development a bit now, I have some silly ASP.NET app ideas. Next step is to find some cheap hosting that can do what I want.
