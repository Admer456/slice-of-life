I’ve been having a lot more ideas for Elegy, regarding car destruction, lightmapped day-night cycles, and I figured out how I’d approach its UI system. Neat.

My schedule is finally clearing up and I will be able to work on Elegy again soon.

I have done work on Elegy. I feel GREAT.

I also realised all the AI work I’ll be doing on Cirkuz 33: Source 2 will be an amazing base to make use of when I work on Elegy Game SDK’s AI. This will be pretty epic.

I’ve once again gotten overrun by the amount of work I have to do, combined with the fact I get out of bed at 13. Damn it.
